# Markov-Decision-Process-Modeling-of-Parking-Facility-for-Dynamic-pricing

This repository consists of two files.

1. utils.py: consists of functions that formulate parking facility as a Markov Decision Process (defining states and actions pairs). Refer to documentation on how states and actions are defined.
2. Main.ipynb: shows implementation of Policy iteration and Value iteration algorithm to solve the same problem.
